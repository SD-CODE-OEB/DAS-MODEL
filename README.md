# üöóüí§‚ö†Ô∏èDriver Drowsiness and Alert System
## ü™úSteps Followed:
### 0Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ - We use opencv and dlib librsries for our system working.
### 0Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ - We capture the real time frame of the Driver.
### 0Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ - We convert the frame to grayscale as cv2 has BGR format colors.We do this to increse optimization and to reduce the amount of processing data...simply a DATA REDUCTION technique.
### 0Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ - From the imported libraries, dlib has a face dection in-built method: get_frontal_face_detector() and in it to identify the face     components such as EYES,NOSE,MOUTH,etc., we use the shape_detector(with parameter of the the file path consisting of the face points of a    face,which is {shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat}).
### 0Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ - Our Parameters for this project are:

- [x] Eye Ratio (Sleepiness)
- [x] Mouth Ratio (Yawning)
- [x] Face in a frame (No Deviation)

### 0Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ - We have also imported the 'winsound' package to sound alarm for alerting the driver.
### 0Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ - The following functions have have been created for their resuability and modularity:
- [x] play_beep()- To sound the alarm.
- [x] eye_aspect_ratio(eye)- To calculate the threshold for drowsy eyes.
- [x] mouth_open(frame) - with its smaller functions to calculate the threshold of Yawning.
- [x] get_landmarks(frame) && show_landmarks(frame,landmarks)- To get landmarks from '.dat' file and show them on a face.

### 0Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ - We now initialize the loop to run our frame/video continiously.
### 0Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ - In the loop, we give the left_eye and right_eye cordinates which can be acquired from the landmarks[] from get_landmarks(frame).
### 1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ - Now, from those co-ordinates we calculate the eye_aspect_ratio() of left and right eye.
### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ - we store the mouth_aspect_ratio() calculating frame in lip_distance variable.
### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ - Based on teh reaserch we have done on the Yawning of humans:
   #####      - Yawns are part of your body‚Äôs process of staying awake.
   #####      - Yawning is also commonly associated with boredom. If your environment isn‚Äôt stimulating, you‚Äôll feel drowsy.
   #####      - Healthcare providers consider excessive yawning as more than three yawns per 15 minutes several times a day.
### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ - From this research, We have set a time constraint of 15 mins using the 'time' package python and initialized current time through "star_time" variable where if the driver yawns for more than 3 times in the given constraint of time , i.e., [ elapsed_time <=  900 ] ,then we buzz the alarm as yawning limit is reached. 
### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ - If the time has elapsed 15 mins with (<=3) yawns , we againbeginthe time counter of 15 mins by resettng the yawns.
### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ - Next, We set the eye_aspect_ratio() constraint with its threshold and buzz alarm when both his eyes are below the threshold.
### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ - The Main-Frame is now intialized, which can be destroyed by presssing the 'ENTER' key.
